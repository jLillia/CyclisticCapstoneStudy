# Cyclistic Capstone Study
Google Data Analytics Certificate capstone study of a bike sharing company, named Cyclistic

## Introduction
The final project of the Google Data Analytics Certificate (hosted on Coursera) invites users to complete a capstone study. The capstone is used to demonstrate some of the core skills users develop throughout the course. I chose to complete a case study on 'Cyclistic', who are a metropolitan bike sharing company.

## Background
- Cyclistic is a bike sharing company, launched in 2016. Since conception, the company has grown to a fleet of nearly 6,000, and nearly 700 docking stations. 
- The company's financial analysts concluded that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. The marketing analysts are responsible to create a campaign to convert casual riders to annual members. 
- This analysis is tasked with answering the following question:
  1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
